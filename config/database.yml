  # The server defaults to notice.

# As with config/credentials.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password or other sensitive information through a
# sensitive environment variable. For example:
#
# production:
#   <<: *default
#   database: blog_production
#   username: blog
#   password: <%= ENV["BLOG_DATABASE_PASSWORD"] %>
#
# By default, this file is ignored by gitgit checkout . Check .gitignore
# to see the ignored files.

production:
  <<: *default
  database: blog_production
  # Use environment variables for sensitive information like passwords
  # username: <%= ENV['DATABASE_USER'] %>
  # password: <%= ENV['DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
